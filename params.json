{"name":"NumCpp","tagline":"NumCpp is a high performance numerical C++ library that provides a simple Numpy/Matlab like interface","body":"### Introduction\r\nNumCpp is a numerical C++ library, which allows to write numerical algorithms in a similar way as in Numpy or Matlab. It uses features of the new C++11 standard simplifying both the implementation of NumCpp and the external API. Here is a simple example of its usage:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <numcpp.h>\r\nusing namespace numcpp;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n  Vector<double> x = ones(16);\r\n  auto y = fft(x);\r\n  auto z = reshape(y,4,4);\r\n\r\n  print(z);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThe features of NumCpp are\r\n\r\n* Simple interface similar to Numpy/Matlab\r\n* Multidimensional array object allowing for strided slicing\r\n* High performance using expression templates\r\n* Mixing of datatypes in expressions\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the [documentation page](http://numcpp.github.com/doc) for an introduction into the concept of NumCpp.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nNumCpp is hosted on [github](https://github.com/tknopp/numcpp) and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tknopp/numcpp/archive/master.zip).\r\nAn introduction how to install and use NumCpp can be found [here](http://tknopp.github.io/numcpp/doc/installation.html)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe base functionallity of NumCpp is licensed under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).\r\nSome modules that require to link against software that is [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) licensed are licensed under the GPL as well. For instance the fft module uses internally the FFTW library, which is licensed under the GPL. If you plan to use NumCpp in a closed source software, please [contact us](mailto:tobias.knopp@gmail.com) to obtain a version of NumCpp where all GPL modules are replaced by GPL-free modules.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor questions and discussions you can use the [google group numcpp](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=de&fromgroups#!forum/numcpp).\r\n\r\nIf you are missing functionality in NumCpp you can either contribute to the project,\r\nor request features on a consulting basis (please [contact us](mailto:tobias.knopp@gmail.com))","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
